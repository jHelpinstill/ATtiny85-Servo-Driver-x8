# ATtiny85-Servo-Driver-x8
Command up to 8 PPM servo motors with an ATtiny85 and a SIPO shift register!

Originally written by me in summer of 2021, I'm now officially creating a repo in order to share it with others. I wrote this software with I2C in mind to create a servo driver accessory, presently it does not have that capability, but it should be rather simple to implement.Back in '21 I had been troubleshooting using an oscilloscope and an elaborate debug method involving viewing signals on one of the 85s pins, if I ever get around to throwing that setup together again I'll add I2C comms. For now I wouldn't want to just blindly include a library since it's liable to break something, but if anyone else wants to try their hand at it by all means go right ahead!
